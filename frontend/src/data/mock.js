  bio: `Ronnie D Dunn is a gospel artist representing Munford, Tennessee and Flint, Michigan, whose music is guided by faith, testimony, and the Spirit of God. Though new to releasing music professionally, Ronnie's journey into music began long before the studio, with roots in church and a life shaped by lived experience and spiritual growth.

His calling to sing came through a dream — a moment of divine confirmation that compelled him to step forward in faith despite being told earlier in life that he "wasn't good enough" to sing. Choosing obedience over doubt, Ronnie allowed God's Spirit to lead both his voice and his story.

Musically inspired by gospel greats such as The Winans, Lee Williams, and Fred Hammond, Ronnie D Dunn delivers uplifting, melody-focused gospel music centered on storytelling, encouragement, and healing. His sound is clean, polished, and purpose-driven, created to inspire listeners, strengthen faith, and leave behind a meaningful legacy rooted in faith and family.`,
